## Prayer for Wedding
Eternal God,
creator and redeemer,
from whom comes every good and perfect gift,
fill Jess and Luke with the riches of your grace
and breathe into their marriage
the strength of your holy and life-giving Spirit.

Send upon them the gift of love
that puts no limit to its faith and forbearance.

Sow in their lives the joy that comes from sharing
and grows with giving.

Let peace spring from their faithfulness to each other
and flow deeper with the passing years.

Give them patience with their failures
and persistence with their hopes.

May their kindness, born of a gracious heart,
be shown to others in a generous spirit.

Let goodness flower with forgiveness
and be the fruit of their married life.

In gentleness let them be tender with each other's dreams
and healing of each other's wounds.

Gracious God,
accept our prayers for Jess and Luke,
that as their love ripens
and their marriage matures
they may reap the harvest of the Spirit,
rejoice in your gifts
and reflect your glory in Christ Jesus our Lord.
