# Weddin-Tracker

This was a project I made to track attendees to my wedding! RSVPs were handled via a form on the wedding site.
They were then posted to a Firebase database, which is where the data is coming from on this site.

It uses Angular and Skeleton CSS.

Mostly done as a way to brush up on Angular while being a TA at the Nashville Software School.
